Run Digital_Watermarking.py file in any python interpreter, i have used terminal to run the code.
keep the images in the directory where the code is present.
we have 4 input images.
when we run Assignment3.py it will ask you for a choice, enter choice as 1 for watermarking method and 2 to perform attacks.

to perform watermarking you have to give images as input, input one name from the saved images either cover.jpg or lena.png and then choose a watermark image name from the saved images either iitbbs_logo.jpeg or logo.png
then it will ask you for output image name, i have performed operation for all combinations and named output images as op1.jpg, op2.jpg, op3.jpg, op4.jpg
then it will start extracting the watermark it will again ask you for output watermark image, i have given names as opw1.jpg, opw2.jpg, opw3.jpg, opw4.jpg respectively.
finally it will print the PSNR value.

to perform attack you have to give image as input, you can give any name from op1.jpg, op2.jpg, op3.jpg, op4.jpg
finally you will get NC values.

if you choose any option other than 1 or 2 the program will terminate.
